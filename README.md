# P2M SITE Dashboard (Vite + React)

Quick scaffolded dashboard using Vite + React, responsive down to 320px.

Run locally:

```bash
cd frontend
# install deps
npm install
# start dev server
npm run dev
```

Notes:

- Uses `chart.js` + `react-chartjs-2` for charts.
- Components live in `src/components`.
- Styles in `src/index.css` include responsive rules and simple animations.
- Hide some widgets on very small screens (<=360px) to keep layout clean.
